The actual area to insert text for the body of the post seems rather small… 

Firefox did not render the preview but that might have been my ad blockers… 

Not sure yet how to actually format the text.

<strong>Is this text bold?</strong>

Doesn’t look like it… 

One underscore: cursive _cursive_

Two underscores: bold __bold__
